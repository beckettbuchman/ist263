        Hi! My name is Beckett Buchman. I'm currently a sophomore at Syracuse studying Business Management in Whitman and Information management 
        in the ISchool with hopes of manganing projects for different tech companies.

        Some skills I have are good communication and interpersonal skills. Ive grown up competing in competitions that needed to be completed as a group in order to get the task done.
        Some accomplishments Ive had are placing second place in sports management at the Vail Deca invitational and being a state finalist in Sports Management. Other accomplishments are 
        being a football captain and helping to found the Outdoor and Fishing Club. My biggest accomplishment was being the Mario kart Champ my senior year.

        Outside of work I like to Camp and spend most of my time outdoors. I enjoy technology and what the new world has to offer but growing up in Colorado I have fallen in love with the outdoors!
        I love to fish and hike as well but also enjoy surfing when Im at a coast or a river!
