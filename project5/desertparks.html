            Sand Dunes National Park (Dunes in the Mountains):
        </h2>
        <p>
            A place I’ve been multiple times and I would always take my best friend Dylan to camp all the
            time throughout childhood and highschool. Sand dunes in the desert of Colorado pressed up
            against the San Juan Mountains. The Dunes seem out of place in this region but provide a
            beauty that is hard to find anywhere else.

        <h2>
            Mesa Verde National Park (A Blast to the Past):
        </h2>
        <p>
            Colorado Oldest National Park offers a special look into Colorado's history and past, as well as
            the history of the nation itself. A place that shows the previous homes and lifestyles of our
            American ancestors also provides a special place in which nature and culture meet to create a
            beautiful landscape.

        <h3>
            History of The Sand Dunes:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The dunes have been a famous landmark for Centuries as it was a landmark for the Spanish
            when exploring the Americas. The dunes became an area in which homesteaders and the
            military would take advantage of the land for years. This included during the gold rush when
            many would flock to the area to pan for gold at the bottom of the dunes. Due to its rich history
            the land was designated a National Monument in 1932 before finally becoming a National Park
            in 2004, being Colorado most recently inducted park.

        <h3>
            History of Mesa Verde:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Though there is confusion of what happened to its people, Mesa Verde is home to many
            different homes and areas that belonged to the native americans. 1400 years ago the land was
            inhabited by those living in the area and held until the departure. They left their homes and
            foundations of other important buildings to their culture and history. After their discovery a
            discussion quickly arose for the government to secure and protect the land. After some trouble
            Mesa Verde became Colorado’s first national park and now offers sights and education on our
            history and Colorado’s history. A Domino effect that created memories for people around the world.

        <h4>Landmark: Zapata Falls</h4>
        <p>
            Zapata Falls is an area famous for its view of the San Luis Valley and the dunes, as well as the
        beauty the secluded falls hold. These Falls are an easy and fun hike to do during the summer
            and are a great place to cool off and hangout around during the hot summer months.

        <h4>Landmark: Spruce Tree House</h4>
        <p>
            My personal favorite dwelling and one of the most famous dwellings in all of America is the
            Spruce tree house, spanning 130 rooms of historical information and culture. These dwellings
            are some of the best preserved and important ruins in history. Due to erosion and the arch
            above the site, it is going through a process to restore the area
