            Rocky Mountain National Park (A Sight only John Denver could sing about):
        </h2>
        <p>
            Personally growing up in Colorado and only about 2 hours away from Estes Park Colorado, I
            can say that Rocky Mountain National Park perfectly encompasses its mountainous beauty.
            Camping in Rocky Mountain are some of my favorite memories and some of the prettiest places
            I’ve ever been to in my life.

        <h2>
            Black Canyon of the Gunnison (The Forgotten Park):
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the farther ones from my hometown, but still a very pretty site to see. A rigid and steep
            canyon that can shake up anyone who dares stand on the edge. Black Canyon is Located near
            Gunnison Colorado and runs 48 miles through one of the steepest canyons in the World. As well
            as being one of the deepest canyons in the world, it has also been one of the least visited
            national parks in the Nation. When you see pictures of it it’s hard to see as its shard cuts and
            jagged landscapes offer many sights for people to see.

            History of Rocky Mountain:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Rocky Mountain Is not the most friendly land, this land made it hard for anybody to settle it or
            live in it for a really long time. The only history being Ute Native Americans and other Tribes
            taking advantage of the green pastures in the summer. After the Louisiana purchase there were
            different expeditions that went through meaning to explore the land and document the newly
            acquired space. During these expeditions they would see the vast beauty and land the area has
            to offer, which in turn created a push to conserve it. After support from different parties President
            Woodrow Wilson would sign the Park in existence, allowing its nature and beauty to be shown
            to different generations.

        <h3>
            History of Black Canyon:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Black Canyon has been famous due to its danger, this danger enticed people who were moving
            west to try to explore the depths of the Canyon for their own and claim pride. Five Famous
            expeditions allowed the service to get a gauge on the area. These expeditions provided insight
            to the river where different legs went, and documented the 48 miles of waterways. The canyon
            is a rough, rigid area that is hard to maneuver through and almost harder to get down and
            through. But thanks to the work of others hundreds of years ago we can now use the canyon 
            that was a National Monument before becoming a park in 1999 to preserve it.

        <h4>Landmark: Emerald Lake</h4>
        <p>
            Emerald Lake is one of the most popular hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park and after doing
            it you can see the reason. Sitting near the top of Flattop Mountain is Emerald Lake, an Alpine
            lake that is home to stunning views of Rock Mountain National Park and the Beautiful mountains
            that dominate the area. The high elevation gain may defer some from going but the hike is
            definitely worth the stunningness that area holds. Go later in the summer to make sure you
            avoid snow and ice as it’s covered in it for most of the year.

        <h4>Landmark: Painted Wall</h4>
        <p>
            Painted wall is one of the bigger walls of the Canyon and offers a beautiful view of the rock
            formations. Showing the big Drop, Painted wall offers a distinct color and erosion pattern that
            helps tell the story of how the canyon was first formed. With a beautiful overlook of the whole
            canyon is a place you will for sure want to swing by.
