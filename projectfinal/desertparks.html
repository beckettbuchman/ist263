                    A place I’ve been multiple times and I would always take my best friend Dylan to camp all the
                    time throughout childhood and highschool. Sand dunes in the desert of Colorado pressed up
                    against the San Juan Mountains. The Dunes seem out of place in this region but provide a
                    beauty that is hard to find anywhere else.

                        History of The Sand Dunes:

                    <p class="infopt">
                        The dunes have been a famous landmark for Centuries as it was a landmark for the Spanish
                        when exploring the Americas. The dunes became an area in which homesteaders and the
                        military would take advantage of the land for years. This included during the gold rush when
                        many would flock to the area to pan for gold at the bottom of the dunes. Due to its rich history
                        the land was designated a National Monument in 1932 before finally becoming a National Park
                        in 2004, being Colorado most recently inducted park.

                        History of Mesa Verde:
                    </h3>
                    <p class="infopt">
                        Though there is confusion of what happened to its people, Mesa Verde is home to many
                        different homes and areas that belonged to the native americans. 1400 years ago the land was
                        inhabited by those living in the area and held until the departure. They left their homes and
                        foundations of other important buildings to their culture and history. After their discovery a
                        discussion quickly arose for the government to secure and protect the land. After some trouble
                        Mesa Verde became Colorado’s first national park and now offers sights and education on our
                        history and Colorado’s history. A Domino effect that created memories for people around the world.

                    <p class="infopt">
                        Zapata Falls is an area famous for its view of the San Luis Valley and the dunes, as well as the
                        beauty the secluded falls hold. These Falls are an easy and fun hike to do during the summer
                        and are a great place to cool off and hangout around during the hot summer months.

                        are some of the best preserved and important ruins in history. Due to erosion and the arch
                        above the site, it is going through a process to restore the area
